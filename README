These scripts are for the preparation and integration of both an equilibrium and transient simulations of the last deglacial 
period using PIK's POEM model. Currently the components being used are: MOM5 in p* coordinates on a tripolar grid,
SIS sea ice model, LM2 (land_lad2) land surface model, Aeolus atmospheric model and the ICE-6G-C ice sheet reconstruction.
